    "\n",
    "You are a die hard Lego enthusiast wishing to collect as many board sets as you can. But before that you wish to be able to predict the price of a new lego product before its price is revealed so that you can budget it from your revenue. Since (luckily!), you are a data scientist in the making, you wished to solve this problem yourself. This dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set etc. Your aim is to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a set.\n",

    "You can see that some of the features of `review_difficulty`, `theme_name` and `Country Name` in the data are textual in nature. Don't worry, we have made things simple for you with some behind-the-scenes data preprocessing.  We have also modified the feature of `age`. You will be learning about all these preprocessing techinques in a later concept. For now let us concentrate on getting those Lego sets in your hands soon. :) \n",
